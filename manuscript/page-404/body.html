Ye're a white-livered cur when all is said.”</p><p>“You call me a coward?”</p><p>“I'll take that liberty.”</p><p>The Breton glared at him, breathing hard. But he had no mind to ask satisfaction for the insult. He knew too well the kind of satisfaction that Captain Blood was likely to afford him. He remembered the fate of Levasseur. So he confined himself to words.</p><p>“It is too much! You go too far!” he complained bitterly.</p><p>“Look you, Cahusac: it's sick and tired I am of your perpetual whining and complaining when things are not as smooth as a convent dining-table. If ye wanted things smooth and easy, ye shouldn't have taken to the sea, and ye should never ha' sailed with me, for with me things are never smooth and easy. And that, I think, is all I have to say to you this morning.”</p></div> </div>

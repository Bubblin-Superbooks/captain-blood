<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>“I usually call things by their names.”</p><p>“Do you? Stab me! I shouldn't boast of it. It argues either extreme youth or extreme foolishness.” His lordship, you see, belonged to my Lord Sunderland's school of philosophy. He added after a moment: “So does the display of ingratitude.”</p><p>A faint colour stirred in her cheeks. “Your lordship is evidently aggrieved with me. I am disconsolate. I hope your lordship's grievance is sounder than your views of life. It is news to me that ingratitude is a fault only to be found in the young and the foolish.”</p><p>“I didn't say so, ma'am.” There was a tartness in his tone evoked by the tartness she had used. “If you would do me the honour to listen, you would not misapprehend me. For if unlike you I do not always say precisely what I think, at least I say precisely what I wish to convey. To be ungrateful may be human; but to display it is childish.”</p></div> </div>
